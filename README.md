# GoPlayGtag-
Fix for the update and adds ComputerInterface toggle! i really won't be making the text customizable using computer interface soon as you may have seen if you read the source code 😏. also don't mind if you might see "GoPlayGtag" on your ci screen that's just because i totally never almost implemented text customization before the caves update
